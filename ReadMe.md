# Artificial Intelligence

This repo displays all of the Artificial Intelligence projects I have done (so far just the homework projects for Harvard CS50AI). In this ReadMe below there will be a gif featuring each project along with the project name. In order to see the code just scroll up and click the corresponding folder.


## CS50AI Degrees 

Degrees is a python program that utilizes a Breadth-first Search to search through over a million actors and movies to find how many degrees one actor is from another.

## CS50AI Tic Tac Toe

This implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" allows to play an AI program that uses the MiniMax algorithm to make its decisions for which move to make. You will never win against this program.

## CS50AI Knights And Knaves

Knights and Knaves uses knowledge engineering to take how a human would solve a problem and convert it into a way that computer could solve it using logic.

Knights And Knaves rules: 
1. A Knight can only and always tell the truth
2. A Knave can only and always tell a lie
